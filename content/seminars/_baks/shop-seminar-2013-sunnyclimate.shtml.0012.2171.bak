      Use Storytelling to Win Cases</strong></h5>
    <p>Advanced Trial Skills is a multi-faceted exploration of how to use storytelling to win cases and vindicate clients. Use story methodology to: find and shape the evidence in the case; investigate case facts, events and witness accounts; and transform the case theory into a coherent and credible narrative that will engage your jurors’  senses, hearts and minds as it reveals the story of innocence. Learn how to create compelling and persuasive stories for the case, when to use them, and how to use storytelling techniques and tools to bring the story to life for the listener. Embrace and empower your inner storyteller and win cases.<a href="/pdfs/seminars/2013_Sunny_Climate.pdf" target="new"> Download a flier.</a></p>
