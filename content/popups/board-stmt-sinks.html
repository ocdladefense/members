  <h5>Board Candidate Statement<br />
District 6 </h5>
  <p>We know change is coming. We don&rsquo;t know if it will be for the better.<br />
  The looming budget shortfall in Oregon leaves the state facing an array of
    difficult choices. And while most of those options will hurt, it is incumbent
    on us to ensure that Oregon emerges from this crisis stronger &ndash; and
    with saner public safety policy. </p>
<p>This space is reserved for my candidate statement. I can sum that up quickly:
  Please vote for me.<br />
  I have been honored to serve the past two years on the OCDLA Board of Directors,
  and I am seeking election to a second term. I have been proud to offer the
  perspective of a juvenile law attorney on the Board, to help with conferences
  and outreach, and to speak on behalf of OCDLA at the Capitol.</p>
<p>Your all-volunteer
  Board is collaborative and is working for you, and we are committed to helping
  the OCDLA navigate these turbulent economic and political times.</p>
<p>But I also
  cannot sugarcoat our situation: We face a daunting challenge.</p>
<p>The state&rsquo;s
  budget chasm will demand more than nibbling at the edges of reform. Oregon
  will need to reinvent itself and reexamine what is truly a &ldquo;core service.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rahm
  Emanuel, chief of staff for President Barack Obama, famously said that you
  should &ldquo;never let a crisis go to waste.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We should not.</p>
<p>Now is the time to ask whether Oregon can afford to stay the
  course on Measure 11 and to incarcerate more people every year, including the
  mentally ill &ndash; or
  should we instead prioritize education and treatment programs that are proven
  to actually make communities safer.</p>
<p>Now is the time to ask if we want more crime
  and more broken families
  &ndash; or should we instead invest in early prevention efforts and better-trained
  caseworkers.</p>
<p>And while pressure will be intense to spend less representing the
  accused, now is the time to ask whether Oregon can underpay &ndash; and still
  expect justice.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Those choices will affect our practices and our livelihoods.</p>
<p>But it is also
  bigger than us.</p>
<p>We are talking about the future of our state, which will affect
  not just our own families, but every family. There will be winners and losers
  in these austere times.</p>
<p>Oregon should invest in smarter public safety policy&hellip;which
  will mean more dollars for education, human services and natural resources &ndash;
  and ultimately will lead to a better quality of life.</p>
<p>Change is coming, that
  much is certain. We don&rsquo;t know which path leaders
  will choose. Amid the cacophony of conflicting views at the Capitol, it is
  our responsibility to ensure legislators understand which options will lead
  Oregon to a better future.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t just need a voice, we need a megaphone.</p>
<p>Today, more than ever,
  we need the OCDLA.</p>
<p>With the guidance of the Board, OCDLA needs to continue providing
  its signature training programs, and to become an even stronger, nimbler and
  vigilant political engine. </p>
<p>Our future &ndash; and Oregon&rsquo;s future &ndash; demands
  no less.</p>
<p>Please support my candidacy for the OCDLA Board of Directors. </p>
