<h5>Board Candidate Statement<br />
District 2 </h5>
<p>I am seeking re-election to the OCDLA Board because I believe this organization is critical to our shared cause and I feel my experience and commitment would benefit the organization and its members. I have been an active board member for the past two years and hope to continue to share my energy and ideas.<br />
  <br />
I was born in upstate New York, lived for a short time in Florida and then spent most of my childhood in Fairbanks, Alaska. I came&nbsp;to Eugene, Oregon, in 1987 to attend the University of Oregon. In 1991 I took a job for the Oregon Judicial Department as a pretrial release officer. (This was the point in my career when I had the most success in getting people out of jail.)&nbsp;While attending&nbsp;U of O law school I worked for several notable (notorious?) criminal defense lawyers as a clerk, including Marc Spence, Bob Schrank, Bob Larson and Kelly Beckley. I also clerked at the Douglas County District Attorney's Office, where I tried a number of cases for the dark side. Fond memories include trying to appear outraged in the tiny courtroom of Drain Justice Court while responding to the defense of an Indecent Exposure case involving poison oak and the &ldquo;vigorous application&rdquo; of Calamine lotion while driving down I-5. My first felony trial was against this organization&rsquo;s past president, Jim Arneson. Reasonable minds may differ as to how quickly the verdict came, but I am sure we agree that the outcome was in no way related to the skill of the respective lawyers. <br />
<br />
After passing the bar (on Round 2) I became an associate at Horton, Koenig and Barnes, a criminal defense law firm in Eugene. In 1998 I joined the consortium of Lane County Juvenile Lawyer&rsquo;s Association. Mistakenly believing that it was a compliment, I accepted the group&rsquo;s offer to be the co-administrator in 1999 and have since maintained that rewarding position, which involves good times such as fielding complaints from DDAs and judges, contract negotiation and herding my fellow feral cats. I&nbsp;also work part time as a Eugene municipal court judge. <br />
<br />
I am currently a part of the OPDS Quality Assurance Task Force, OCDLA's Juvenile Law Committee and various committees of the Juvenile Court Improvement Project. I have represented the &ldquo;voice of batterers&rdquo; at Lane County&rsquo;s Domestic Violence Council. (Luckily, an angry, disgruntled and sometimes whiney voice comes naturally to me.) I have also been a speaker and moderator at a number of OCDLA conferences and seminars.<br />
<br />
In my spare time, my husband (a capital defender) and I try and convince our two boys and the rest of our friends and family that our jobs are noble. </p>
