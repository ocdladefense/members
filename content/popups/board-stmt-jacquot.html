<h5>Board Candidate Statement<br />
District 3 </h5>
<p>I write to ask each for your vote in the upcoming board elections. I am running for my fourth term as a board member. I&rsquo;ve served two two-year terms in the past, and am currently serving a two-year term. <br />
  In my time on the board I have been involved in some major decisions which will help our great organization remain at the forefront of organizations of its kind for many years. It is important to have a mix of new people with new ideas and more experienced board members with historical knowledge. During my time on the board I have been adept at helping new ideas take root and flourish. As I think about the sentence I just wrote, it seems like b. s. but I think others would say it&rsquo;s true. <br />
  <br />
We still have work to do to solidify OCDLA&rsquo;s position of leadership in the state and country, and I ask for your support. </p>
