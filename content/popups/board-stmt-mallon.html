<h5>Board Candidate Statement<br />
District 6 </h5>
<p>As I was growing up, my mother taught me that it is each person&rsquo;s responsibility to make his or her community a better place by volunteering service to the community. After talking to various current board members, I realized that this organization that I love, OCDLA, is at a crossroads. I feel a responsibility to step up once again and offer my experience and energy to help however I can to guide this organization to a bright future. During my prior four years on the board and my year as president, I helped bring about better funding for indigent defense than we had previously seen. I worked with Ross Shepard to bring the issue before the OSB house of delegates, and was successful in making the indigent defense budget a high priority of the OSB lobbyists. I also helped bring about outreach efforts from OCDLA to our members in the far flung corners of our state. I believe that we as a board were in better touch with our membership than we had ever been up to that point. Now we face some new challenges. Among them are: </p>
<p>&bull; Continuing the fight for stable, adequate funding for indigent defense.</p>
<p>&bull;&nbsp;Finding an office for OCDLA that we own. This makes excellent financial sense.</p>
<p>&bull;&nbsp;Making OCDLA even more valuable to our members who practice juvenile law.</p>
<p>&bull;&nbsp;Planning for that long dreaded day that our Executive Director, John Potter,&nbsp; decides that his time of service to us all is over. We will never be able to replace John, but we are going to have to do something. </p>
<p>I have counted my past service to this organization as some of the most valuable time I have spent, and thank each of you for your past, current and future support. </p>
