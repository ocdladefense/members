<h5>Board Candidate Statement<br />
District 4 </h5>
  <p>I am asking the members to elect me as the private attorney Director from District 4. I have previously served on the Board in that capacity and have served as President of OCDLA from June 2001 to June 2002. Erik Bucher has been serving as your Director, but has decided not to run again. <br />
    <br />
I have been practicing law since 1979. My office has been in Hillsboro, Oregon, since 1996. Before that I worked with the Metropolitan Public Defenders Office in Multnomah and Washington counties, the Juvenile Rights Project and Rieke, Geil and Savage. My practice is exclusively in criminal defense. I represent clients in state and federal courts. My clients are both privately retained and court-appointed.<br />
<br />
I want to return to the Board because we face a number of important issues. I hope and believe my experience will help us deal with these pressing matters. In particular, we must maintain and strengthen our approaches to legislative and ballot measure issues. This is an ever expanding and evolving topic. This includes supporting public defense in order to provide adequate pay and reasonable caseloads. OCDLA must also continue to play an important role in speaking for those who have no voice. I also believe it is also important to maintain and expand practical training for criminal defense lawyers. I have been active in the annual Trial College in Eugene. Results from this &ldquo;hands on&rdquo; experience have been impressive. The Board should continue to develop practical training approaches in cooperation with the Education Committee. Fiscal responsibility is also an important aspect of Board membership. To that end I support the process of purchasing a modest building in Eugene to house OCDLA operations. As a Board member I will be cautious with our budget and maintain reserves that are adequate and appropriate for a nonprofit organization. <br />
<br />
I believe in consensus building and consensus decision making. This was my approach the last time I served on the Board and is the path I will continue to take. I have valued my membership in OCDLA for 30 years. It is a well run and respected organization. If I am elected to the Board, I intend to see that continues. </p>
