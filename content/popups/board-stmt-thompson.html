<h5>Board Candidate Statement<br />
District 6 </h5>
<p>I am interested in being a member of the OCDLA Board because I believe I can assist OCDLA in that capacity. I have been a member of the Board of Directors of the Marion County Association of Defenders (MCAD) for over 10 years. I was the President of the Board for two years and have been the MCAD Treasurer for the past three plus years. As an MCAD Board member I learned about the funding issues we and OPDS face.</p>
<p>I have been practicing criminal defense work primarily in Marion County since I was admitted to the bar in 1982. The best events I have attended have been connected with OCDLA and I want to make sure this organization continues its excellent events and continues to support its newer members. I also think we need to think about what we are providing our more experienced members, although the death penalty CLE every year should be attend by the &ldquo;experienced&rdquo; lawyers among us whether they are interested in doing death penalty work or not. The ideas and materials that come from that CLE are invaluable for non death penalty work. </p>
<p>I hope you will allow me to continue to serve the defense community in an area larger than just Marion County.</p>
