<h5>Board Candidate Statement<br />
  District 5 <br />
</h5>
<p>I am asking for the privilege to serve another two years on the OCDLA Board
  of Directors. In the past two years on the Board, I have been an active participant
  in all Board meetings and functions. I have held the office of Secretary in
  my second year on the Board, and I want to continue to serve the organization
and its members. </p>
<p>When preparing this statement, I started to list my accomplishments
  and detail my involvement with OCDLA and the Board of Directors, but as I did
  so, I realized that chronicling my achievements is the antithesis of being
  a member of the Board of Directors. The Board is a collective of individuals
  exercising stewardship over the organization known as OCDLA. Key to that stewardship
  is Board members working together to address concerns, test ideas and question
  issues before making formal commitments. The Board addresses issues from pricing
  the laminate &ldquo;Quick
Guides&rdquo; to purchasing a building for the organization.</p>
<p>All of these decisions
  are made with careful and thoughtful discussion. Board discussions are dynamic
  and rely on the relationships and trust that develops among and between the
  members. I have worked very hard to develop meaningful relationships between
  my fellow board members, and I have earned their trust, as they have earned
mine.</p>
<p>In addition to my experience working with the individuals currently on
  the Board of Directors, I ask that you consider the nature of my practice.
  I am exclusively an Oregon lawyer. Through my firm, Squires &amp; Lopez, I
  specialize in criminal defense. Although I am a member of the state and federal
  bars of Oregon, I devote the bulk of my practice to indigent criminal defense
  in the state court system. I am committed to securing adequate funding for
  court-appointed case work, as well as overall funding for the judicial branch.
  As an organization, we have no other issue more important to our members than
  maintaining funding for indigent defense. I cannot say that I alone can or
  will effect legislative funding decisions, but I can say that it is the issue
central to my livelihood, and I will not let it fall by the wayside.</p>
<p>In the
  next two years, I believe OCDLA needs to take the lead in the establishment
  of statutory requirements for preservation of DNA evidence in criminal cases,
  as well as the formulation of legal avenues to use that evidence to challenge
  convictions. The current state of the law in Oregon, as in many states, is
  deplorable. I would like the opportunity, as a Board member, to help OCDLA
  change Oregon&rsquo;s
laws regarding preservation and utilization of DNA evidence. </p>
<p>I ask for your
  support to give me the privilege of serving a second term on your Board, and
  for the opportunity to complete my goals (building purchase and holding Board
  office), and to continue to provide stewardship for our organization. I appreciate
  your trust in me. I will not let you down. Thank you, and please contact me
  for any questions or concerns you may have. <br />
