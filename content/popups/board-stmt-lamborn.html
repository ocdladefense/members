<h5>Board Candidate Statement<br />
At-large Position</h5>
  <p>It has been an honor and a pleasure to serve as the At-Large Director of the OCDLA Board of Directors these past two years. <br />
    <br />
This has been a challenging time for the Board. We as defenders have been bombarded from many different directions. The economy's recent uncertainty has effected this organization as it has so many of our practitioners. Revenue is down everywhere, while at the same time opponents to our cause of liberty have mounted continuing efforts to imprison more and more of our population. The Board has reacted well to these attacks by raising substantial funds to provide credible and effective lobbying in the Legislature. Kudos to you, the members of OCDLA, for responding to our continued pleas to support these efforts by participating in our auctions and fund-raising efforts. Without you, as is so often the case, the other side wins.<br />
<br />
The Board continues to make it our mission to provide you with excellent educational and professional networking opportunities and materials. If you are a sole practitioner, a member of a consortium or other public defender group, you have access to a wide array of our professional practice tools. Chances are you have something as simple as our Sentencing Guidelines Grid on your desk or our Criminal Law Formbook on your shelf. Or maybe you just collect information from the Pond from time to time. The resources available to you as a member of OCDLA give you an edge over your opponent. All these things are produced and made available to you through the supervision of the Board of Directors.<br />
<br />
I am continually impressed by the time and thought put into this organization by my fellow Board members. I look forward to serving OCDLA for  another two years and ask for your vote to retain me as your Director At-Large. Thank you for the opportunity to continue to serve.</p>
