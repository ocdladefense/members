<h5>Board Candidate Statement<br />
District 5 </h5>
  <p>David McDonald leaves big shoes to fill in the District 5 Board position.&nbsp;His enthusiasm for criminal defense, OCDLA and its functions draws a clear road map for those of us who want to make a positive contribution through board membership.&nbsp;My feet are smaller, but I am looking forward to following up on David&rsquo;s efforts and bringing my voice and energy to the OCDLA Board. <br />
    <br />
  Stepping outside of my practice to contribute to our defense community has been an important aspect of my career.&nbsp; I have enjoyed serving on the OCDLA Education Committee, presenting at seminars and working informally with lobbyists and legislators on OCDLA&rsquo;s efforts to impact relevant legislation. &nbsp;I feel that now is the time to take on a more integral role in the continuing growth and development of our organization by serving as your representative on our Board.<br />
  <br />
  As a board member, I hope to expand my contribution to our community. I aim to ensure a continued focus on OCDLA&rsquo;s time-tested functions &ndash;&nbsp; to keep our membership on the cutting edge with continuing education seminars and the Library of Defense and to make our collective voice heard on targeted legislative action in Salem.&nbsp;I will also keep the board exploring new ideas and fresh topics, as OCDLA benefits from the innovation and creativity of its membership. &nbsp;We are one of the, if not the most, supportive criminal defense organizations in the nation, and our future gets brighter everyday as new zealous defenders become a part of our community. I want to be in a place to help steer us into the future, and I ask that you support me for the Board.</p>
