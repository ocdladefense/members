<h5>Board Candidate Statement<br />
District 5 </h5>
<p>Being part of the Board over the past two years has broadened my knowledge of the depth and complexity of this organization and given me new ideas on how to help us continue to change and develop as the society and legal system continues to change around us. I continue to draw strength and wisdom from many of you and appreciate the support OCDLA and its members have given to me and to our Board over the past two years. I want to continue to work as a Board member to the benefit of this organization and am asking that you support me for a second term.</p>
<p> When I first ran for this Board, I anticipated that I would be able to focus on certain new areas that previously had not been addressed. One of those issues was victims&rsquo; rights issues and to that end, we have developed a Defendants&rsquo; Rights Group that is focused on analyzing and synthesizing issues involving what I have called the Third Wave of the criminal justice system, the explosion of victims&rsquo; rights issues.</p>
<p>As a group we have identified many areas of importance including educating our members on the issues involved through our CLE programs, identifying the organizations supporting what have been defined as victims&rsquo; rights and making judgments on their strengths and weaknesses as well as identifying certain areas where we might have common ground, reviewing legislation for our legislative committee and providing information to our lobbyists regarding bills that were pending. We have also taken direct action on each of the issues, including providing information and proposed testimony on two bills that are no longer viable, and will continue to do so as the organizations supporting these rights become more and more financially stable, politically motivated and active in litigation within our courts.</p>
<p>In addition, the work of Board members is fluid and varied, from selling raffle tickets to work on budget and membership issues. I have worked to be active in all aspects of the Board&rsquo;s obligations and duties and will continue to work in any way I can to help to keep our organization vibrant, relevant and solvent. One of the new and exciting decisions our board has made is to change the face of our web presence so that we can make the OCDLA webpage a one-stop center for all of your criminal law needs. The new design and content of the new web presence are exciting and developing quickly and you will hear more about the expansion at our annual meeting. </p>
<p>I have always believed strongly in the power of this organization and in the vibrancy and energy of our members. I am honored to continue to serve on our Education Committee, Legislative Committee and Defendant&rsquo;s Rights Group. I hope you will allow me to also continue to serve you as a member of your Board. Thank you. </p>
