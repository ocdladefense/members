<h5>Board Candidate Statement<br />
  District 1 <br />
</h5>
<p>It has been a pleasure representing the OCDLA and the membership of District 1 in Eastern Oregon. Working in rural Oregon is wonderful. The caliber of attorneys and the professionalism here never ceases to amaze me. Over the last two years, the experience on the Board has been fantastic and I am asking for another term as your representative. <br />
  <br />
In the last two years, I have been involved in restructuring our lobbying effort in Salem in the hope that we can advocate effectively for increased, stable funding for public defense in Oregon and bring a strong, consistent voice for fairness in our criminal justice system. As a result of the restructuring, we have a new professional lobbyist&mdash;Jennifer Williamson, who has a strong plan to promote our organization&rsquo;s vision for fiscal and policy justice in Oregon. <br />
<br />
During my term, the Board has taken a number of positive steps to improving services to our membership. The long-term goals of the Board will ensure another 30 years of growth in our organization.</p>
<p>Thank you for your vote.</p>
