<h5>Board Candidate Statement<br />
District 2 </h5>
  <p>I have served on the board for the past two years, including the most recent year as Vice President. During that time I have gained invaluable knowledge of our organization's historical and day-to-day operations, so much that I question the wisdom of electing board members for less than a four-year term. The OCDLA board is striving hard to serve all of its members, expand services, and hold membership costs steady. The challenge of meeting those goals requires knowledge and commitment by every board member. I am seeking re-election because of the knowledge I have gained, the commitment I have demonstrated, and the desire for the OCDLA&mdash;with the help of all members&mdash;to grow ever stronger.<br />
