<h5>Board Candidate Statement<br />
District 1 </h5>
<p>I have been honored to have served on the Board the past two years. I enjoy the dedication to a greater cause that I see in this organization and its Board members. I have found the entire experience enlightening, informative and a great way to give back to the OCDLA a bit of what it provides me. I am able to give the time that is needed to further the organization to the benefit of all its members. I also have a broad base of experience. I worked in the public defender capacity for Klamath Defender Services for 14 years. I have handled private cases and now I have a capital case contract.<br />
  <br />
  I believe OCDLA embodies the depth of dedication and passionate commitment to a greater good that exists in each of its members. I am honored to serve that greater good. I hope that you all agree I can continue to serve you and I encourage all of the members in the district that I represent to contact me with issues or concerns. I will strive to ensure all your needs and goals are met to the greatest extent possible through the OCDLA.<br />
  <br />
I am always honored by the pack with which I run. Many people in the general public do not understand us or our role until a family member or close friend needs our services. The camaraderie provided by OCDLA helps assuage this sense of societal isolation and lifts our spirits each time we come together to gain better tools for the fight. In those gatherings we share stories of trial losses, which engender commiseration and the realization that you are not alone, and stories of victories, which garner kudos and congratulations and open the door to the sharing by our colleagues of similar stories. OCDLA educates us, advocates for us and provides spiritual revival and sustenance. I would be honored to serve another term on its Board. I hope you will allow me the gift of that honor. </p>
<p>All the best,<br />
  Eve Oldenkamp </p>
