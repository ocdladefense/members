          <h6><strong>Zip Files</strong></h6>
          <p>If you find that your Zip Archive does not expand or you encounter an error after downloading, you may need to download expansion software, although most computers come with built in expansion software.</p>

          <p><strong>Choosing Open — </strong>If you select  <strong>Open </strong>(see <span class="style2">Note</span> below if you choose Save instead), the download will take a few moments and then you will see another window that says this: “Do you want to open this file?” Click <strong>Open</strong>. You will see a window that shows the downloaded files on the right. </p>
          <p><strong>Choosing Save — </strong>If you select <strong>Save</strong> you will see a window that shows your where the files will be saved.

          <p><strong>Choosing Open</strong> — Your system is probably already set to decompress and open zips automatically with sofware that came with your computer. But if not,  select the decompression software you want to use. At OCDLA, we use Stuffit Expander. Click <strong>OK</strong>. The software will download to the area on your computer where downloads are stored.</p>
          <p><strong>Choosing Save</strong> — If you choose <strong>Save</strong>, the zip will be saved in the Downloads folder, or, if you have changed this settting on your computer, into the folder you have selected for downloads. </p>
